Reploy is a app development tool for iOS and Android that allows you to test your builds with an in-browser simulator. Reploy makes it easy to keep your team and customers in the loop by allowing invitations to be sent out to testers. Testers can then capture a screenshot on any screen within the simulator and start a discussion thread.

Reploy can also be integrated seamlessly with your CI process. Our cli(link) extends options that allow developers to integrate their app with one simple command.

Using Github? If your pull requests are triggering your CI builds. Reploy will post a status update after each build with a URL to test that build within a simulator.
